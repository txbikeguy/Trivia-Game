So I spent quite a few hours(probably more than I should have) initially to make the html and css look super cool. I feel like I defintely went above and beyond there and did something out of the box things.

Then I got around to trying to write the actual game in javascript and ran into a lot of mental blocks. At one point I had a working start screen with game instructions and a button that would clear the start screen and load the first question and answer choices, and start the timer. 

At that point I tried a billion things and just couldn't figure out how I should structure things to make the next question show up after the first, etc. 

I was coming down to the wire and I decided to watch the Solution video in the class repo to try to get ideas and see where I could make changes.

I ended up basically re-writing my entire JS according to the solution video, which actually helped me a lot to learn how  and when things should be written and how they affect other aspects of the game. 

I still feel pretty in the deep end as far as javascript goes but I still really enjoyed this activity and had a lot of fun styling my game and adding fonts, etc.
